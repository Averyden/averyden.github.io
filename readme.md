# Unnamed Y2K-esk project
This is a web project I am working on in my freetime.
It's more or less just typescript learning i suppose (。・ω・。)

## False nostalgia
The single goal of this website is to try and recreate one of those personal websites youd see back in the early 2000s o(≧∀≦)o

## Notice 
it currently looks horrid on mobile devices... sorryy {{{(>_<)}}} (i CBA to fix it right now)
I also need to figure out a proper way to make github pages autocompile all my typescript so i can finally add javascript to my .gitignore (i dont like the javascript files bloating up this repository and adding its ugly yellow color to my stats ＞︿＜)
