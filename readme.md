# Portfolio Site
This is a web project I am working on in my freetime.
It's more or less just typescript learning i suppose (。・ω・。)

## False nostalgia
The single goal of this website is to try and recreate one of those personal websites youd see back in the early 2000s o(≧∀≦)o

## Notice 
This is far from the final product, the ultimate goal is to have several routes that show different cool things... maybe even tiny cute games? o(*^▽^*)┛
